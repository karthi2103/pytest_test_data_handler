# PYTEST EXAMPLE TO INJECT TEST DATA TO TESTS

This is a sample project to demonstrate on how to inject test data from json file to a pytest test with strong type hinting.

To demonstrate the concept, I have written a sample email service with minimal logic and all tests are written to test the service.

* the sample email service can be seen [here](https://github.com/karthi2103/pytest_test_data_handler/blob/main/service/send_email.py)

* test example can be found [here](https://github.com/karthi2103/pytest_test_data_handler/blob/main/tests/email/test_email.py)

* data resolvers can be found [here](https://github.com/karthi2103/pytest_test_data_handler/blob/main/tests/data_util/data_resolver.py)

* for detailed explaination check this blog [post](https://www.testcult.com/handle-test-data-the-right-way-in-pytest/)
