# PYTEST EXAMPLE TO INJECT TEST DATA TO TESTS

This is a sample project to demonstrate on how to inject test data from json file to a pytest test with strong type hinting.
To demonstrate the concept, I have written a sample email service with minimal logic and all tests are written to test the service.
the service can be seen [here]()
test example can be found [here](https://google.com)
data resolvers can be found [here]()
